Project 3 Visualizing Data

A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale:
F1 racing data for races, track, lap times, we can select by each year/season. To showcase season’s race, lap times, and winners. The 2021 season was a very competitive race where Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton were being challenged by Red Bull racing and Max Verstappen leading up to the controversial 2021 season finale race. The user will be able to use the drop down to choose the race event and see lap times and winner to see season data.
